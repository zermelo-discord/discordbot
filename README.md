# ZermeloDiscord 
ZermeloDiscord is an opensource Discord Bot that makes it possible to display your current schedule in Discord and notify you of new lesson cancellations. This project is made with [Zermelo4J](https://www.github.com/MrWouterNL/Zermelo4J), a Java wrapper for the Zermelo API. 

## Can I host this myself?
Yes, ofcourse! All you need to do is change the variables in the Main class. It'd be appreciated if you'd credit is for the work we did.

This project is not created by nor associated in any way with Zermelo Software BV.
